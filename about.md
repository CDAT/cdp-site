## About

The Community Diagnostics Package (CDP) is a framework for creating new climate diagnostic packages in a generalized manner. 
Designed in an object-oriented method, CDP allows for a modular implementation of the components required for running diagnostics. 
The design of CDP consists of modules to handle the user-defined parameters, metrics, provenance, 
file I/O, output of results and algorithms for calculating the diagnostics.
